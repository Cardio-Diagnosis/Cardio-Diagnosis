# HackTrin2016


Collaborators: Vaed Prasad, Henry Hunt, Grant Goldenberg, Justin Burton

Inspiration:
The inspiration was to create a prototype of a product that diagnosis patients with different heart related illnesses.

What it does:
Cardio Kit is a sleeve and pulse sensor that allows users to detect heart rate and muscle activity. By analyzing the heart beat trends and rates we can determine an accurate diagnosis for the user.

How I built it:
The program runs off of Arduino and detects if a users heart rate is abnormally high for a certain activity. Through this information we can accurately diagnosis patients with heart related diseases such as V-Tac. We also created a website to display the product and the development which will eventually be used to sell future products.

Challenges I ran into:
We had to correctly wire and program the Arduino board to detect heart pulse and muscle activity and utilize the information to make an accurate diagnosis.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
We had to use a hot glue gun to construct our own sleeve and hand-sew the sleeve together. We also soldered all the wires from the Arduino board. We were also able to analyze two different sets of data to make a diagnosis: Muscle Activity and Pulse.

What I learned:
We learned how to wire an Arduino board, create a pulse sleeve, and build a website.

What's next for Cardio Kit:
Creating further prototypes and making more accurate sensors. We would like to expand the number of diseases that Cardio-Kit can detect.

8:30am-9:30am: Welcome and sponsor presentations.

9:30am-12:30pm: Coding and workshops (HTML/CSS, Arduino, p5.js).

12:30pm-1:00pm: Lunch

1:00pm-4:00pm: Coding

4:00pm-6:00pm: Presentations and Awards




Rules:

1) Build something related to wellness and fitness. You can make your project in any language(s) and programs you wish. Projects will be judged on complexity of code, aesthetic quality, and creativity/usefulness of the idea.

2) Starting Wednesday, January 27th coding is permitted. Any teams who start work on their projects before this date will be disqualified. Coding will end at 4 pm on January 31st, with all computers closed and put away at this time.

3) All teams must present their projects in less than three minutes, sending one presenter per team, and must run the project in real time on a team members’ device for the presentation.

4) Feel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, shortcuts, or workarounds you’ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. You may use any frameworks, hosting services, etc.

5) Teams must compete in groups of 2-4 students, and are allowed to be mixed from different schools.

6) Each school represented must have one adult chaperone employed by the school at the hackathon on Sunday.

7) Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.

8) Most importantly – have fun! This is a learning event so feel free to consult any documentation, mentors, and tutorials that you wish, but all code should be completed by team members.
