Rules:

1) Build something related to wellness and fitness. You can make your project in any language(s) and programs you wish. Projects will be judged on complexity of code, aesthetic quality, and creativity/usefulness of the idea.

2) Starting Wednesday, January 27th coding is permitted. Any teams who start work on their projects before this date will be disqualified. Coding will end at 4 pm on January 31st, with all computers closed and put away at this time.

3) All teams must present their projects in less than three minutes, sending one presenter per team, and must run the project in real time on a team members’ device for the presentation.

4) Feel free to use any tools, tricks, gems, shortcuts, or workarounds you’ve discovered over the years to help you build quicker. You may use any frameworks, hosting services, etc.

5) Teams must compete in groups of 2-4 students, and are allowed to be mixed from different schools.

6) Each school represented must have one adult chaperone employed by the school at the hackathon on Sunday.

7) Teams have full ownership of everything they build at our events and are free to do with it as they wish.

8) Most importantly – have fun! This is a learning event so feel free to consult any documentation, mentors, and tutorials that you wish, but all code should be completed by team members.
